### Running the Code 
#### Creating Virtual Environment
To create the virtual environment run the following code in your terminal, you can rename `env` to any name you want for your virtual environment.`python -m venv env`.

In the event the virtual environment has not yet been activate, you need to run the following command: `env\Scripts\activate.bat`. This might defer based on which machine you're using, I was using Visual Studio Code on a Windows and the command prompt as terminal. 

#### Install all the dependencies 
After creating the virtual environment, run the following command, this will download all the required libraries required to replicate the code. `python pip install -r requirements.txt`

#### Executing main.py
To run the main file run the following command within your terminal `python main.py`.
